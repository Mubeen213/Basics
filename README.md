# Basics

GRAPHQL vs REST Summary

### REST vs GraphQL: Summary

**REST** (Representational State Transfer) and **GraphQL** are both approaches for building APIs, but they have different philosophies and use cases.

#### 1. **REST:**
- **Concept:** REST is based on resources, with URLs representing various endpoints (e.g., `/users`, `/orders`). Each URL corresponds to a specific resource, and operations on those resources (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are performed using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

- **How it works:**
    - Each resource is represented by an endpoint.
    - Clients make requests to specific endpoints and receive fixed responses, often in JSON format.
    - Responses contain all available data for the requested resource.

#### 2. **GraphQL:**
- **Concept:** GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request specific data. Instead of fixed endpoints, there is only one entry point (e.g., `/graphql`), and clients define the structure of the response.

- **How it works:**
    - Clients send a query describing the data they need.
    - The server resolves this query and returns data in exactly the requested shape.
    - It supports real-time subscriptions for data changes.

### When to Use REST vs GraphQL

| **Scenario**                  | **Use REST**                                     | **Use GraphQL**                                  |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Simple, well-defined API**   | REST is often better for simple, resource-based APIs with clear endpoints. | If your API is complex and clients may want to fetch multiple resources in one request. |
| **Predictable Data Structure** | When clients need the same structure each time.  | When different clients (mobile, web) need different structures of the same data.        |
| **Caching**                    | REST works well with HTTP caching mechanisms.    | GraphQL caching is more complex, but possible with proper setup.                       |
| **Over-fetching/Under-fetching**| If clients need all the data at once.            | If clients need to avoid over-fetching (e.g., just a few fields of a resource).         |
| **Versioning**                 | REST often uses different versions of endpoints. | GraphQL avoids versioning by allowing clients to specify exactly what they need.        |
| **Real-time data**             | REST is not ideal for real-time updates (but can use WebSockets). | GraphQL supports real-time data via subscriptions.                                     |

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### **REST Advantages:**
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and widely adopted. Simple URLs and HTTP methods.
- **Caching**: Strong support for caching via HTTP headers.
- **Separation of concerns**: Clearly defined endpoints for each resource.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works well with browser behavior (e.g., back buttons, caching).

#### **REST Disadvantages:**
- **Over-fetching/Under-fetching**: Clients may receive more or less data than needed.
- **Multiple Requests**: In complex apps, multiple requests might be needed to gather related resources (e.g., `/users` followed by `/users/:id/posts`).

#### **GraphQL Advantages:**
- **Efficient Data Fetching**: Clients can request exactly what they need, avoiding over-fetching and under-fetching.
- **Single Endpoint**: Simplifies API structure by exposing only one endpoint for all operations.
- **Flexibility**: Ideal for complex apps where different clients (mobile vs. desktop) need different data.
- **Real-time support**: Built-in support for subscriptions (real-time updates).

#### **GraphQL Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity**: More complex to set up on both server and client side compared to REST.
- **Caching**: Requires custom solutions for caching.
- **Overhead on Small APIs**: For simpler APIs, GraphQL may be overkill.
- **Performance Concerns**: N+1 query issues can arise if the server isn't optimized properly.

---

### Examples

#### REST Example:
**Endpoint**: `GET /users/1`
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "posts": [
        {"id": 101, "title": "First Post"},
        {"id": 102, "title": "Second Post"}
      ]
    }
    ```

If you want just the user’s name, you would still get the entire response, which might include unnecessary data.

#### GraphQL Example:
**Query**:
```graphql
{
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "user": {
          "name": "John Doe",
          "posts": [
            {"title": "First Post"},
            {"title": "Second Post"}
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

The client receives only the data it asked for, no more and no less.

---

### Conclusion
- **REST** is great for simple, resource-based APIs with well-defined and stable data structures.
- **GraphQL** shines when the API has complex relationships between data, and clients need more control over what they fetch.

For example, if you're building an API for a simple service like a blog, REST might be sufficient. But if you're building a complex app with many interrelated resources and multiple types of clients (web, mobile, etc.), GraphQL might be a better fit.



The **N+1 query problem** occurs in GraphQL (and other ORMs or data-fetching systems) when a query causes inefficient repeated database queries due to poor data fetching strategies, especially when resolving nested relationships.

### When N+1 Problem Occurs

Let's consider a simple GraphQL query:

```graphql
{
  users {
    name
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

- First, GraphQL resolves the `users` field, which might execute **1 query** to fetch all users, like:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users;
  ```

- Then, for each user, GraphQL resolves the `posts` field. If there are N users, GraphQL could potentially make **N queries** to fetch the posts for each individual user:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = 1;
  SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = 2;
  ...
  SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id = N;
  ```

Thus, the system ends up making 1 query for users + N queries for posts (one per user). This is the **N+1 query problem**, as it results in **1 query to get users** + **N queries to get related posts**, leading to inefficient data fetching, especially as `N` grows large.

### Why the N+1 Problem Occurs

The N+1 problem arises because of how GraphQL (or other data-fetching layers) resolves fields independently. For each user, it fetches the associated posts by making individual queries, rather than fetching all necessary data at once. This typically happens when:
1. **Resolvers are not optimized**: The GraphQL server queries the database separately for each relationship (e.g., users and their posts).
2. **Lack of batching**: When multiple similar queries are executed independently, rather than being batched into a single query.

In the previous example, resolving each `posts` field for every user triggers a separate database query, causing inefficiency.

### How to Prevent the N+1 Problem

To avoid the N+1 problem, **batching and optimizing data fetching** is critical. Some common strategies include:

1. **Use DataLoader (or Similar Tools)**:
    - In Node.js, Facebook’s [DataLoader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) is a common solution. It batches and caches database requests, allowing you to fetch related data in a single query.
    - Instead of fetching posts one by one for each user, DataLoader can batch these requests, generating a single query like:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id IN (1, 2, 3, ..., N);
      ```
      This reduces the number of queries from N+1 to just 2 queries (1 for users and 1 for posts).

2. **Join Queries in the Backend**:
    - For relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL), you can optimize the resolver by joining tables or using a more efficient query that fetches users and their posts in one go:
      ```sql
      SELECT users.*, posts.* 
      FROM users
      LEFT JOIN posts ON posts.user_id = users.id;
      ```

3. **GraphQL Schema Design**:
    - Carefully design your schema and resolvers to minimize the need for repeated lookups. Group data in ways that reduce the need for nested queries.

4. **Batching in ORMs**:
    - If using an ORM (like Sequelize or TypeORM), take advantage of "eager loading" or "preloading" features, which allow fetching related data (e.g., users and their posts) in a single query, rather than fetching them in separate steps.

### Example with DataLoader

Here’s how DataLoader might be implemented in a GraphQL resolver:

```js
const DataLoader = require('dataloader');

// Create a DataLoader for posts
const postLoader = new DataLoader(async userIds => {
  const posts = await Post.findAll({
    where: {
      userId: userIds
    }
  });
  
  // Group posts by userId
  return userIds.map(userId => posts.filter(post => post.userId === userId));
});

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users: () => {
      return User.findAll();
    }
  },
  User: {
    posts: (parent) => {
      // Use DataLoader to batch the post queries
      return postLoader.load(parent.id);
    }
  }
};
```

In this example:
- `postLoader.load(parent.id)` batches requests for posts across users and fetches them with a single query. This eliminates the N+1 problem.

### When to Take Care of It

You should address the N+1 problem **early in development**, especially if:
- Your GraphQL queries involve nested relationships (e.g., users and their posts, or orders and their items).
- You expect the number of related entities (e.g., users or posts) to grow large, causing performance issues.
- You notice performance degradation in query execution due to many database hits (high latency, slower response times).

Even if the API is small initially, it’s best to plan for scalability and avoid N+1 queries when you foresee potential scaling in your application.



## HTTP and HTTPS

1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between web browsers and servers.

Why it exists:
HTTP was created to standardize communication between clients (usually web browsers) and servers. It allows for requesting and receiving web resources like HTML pages, images, and other data.

How it works:
- A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to a server.
- The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.
- The response contains status information and possibly requested content.

2. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)

HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.

Why it exists:
HTTPS was developed to provide secure communication over the internet. It prevents eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.

How it works:
- HTTPS uses encryption to secure the data transmitted between the client and server.
- It utilizes SSL/TLS protocols for this encryption.

3. Security in HTTPS

HTTPS provides security through:
- Encryption: Scrambling the data so it can't be read by unauthorized parties.
- Authentication: Verifying that you're communicating with the intended website.
- Integrity: Detecting any changes or corruption in the transmitted data.

4. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security)

SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over a computer network.

- SSL was the original protocol, but it has been deprecated due to security vulnerabilities.
- TLS is the modern, more secure version of SSL.

How they help in security:
- They establish an encrypted connection between client and server.
- They authenticate the identity of the server (and sometimes the client).
- They ensure data integrity during transmission.

5. Encryption and Decryption

Encryption is the process of converting data into a form that looks like meaningless gibberish to anyone who doesn't have the decryption key.

How it works:
- The sender encrypts the data using an encryption algorithm and a key.
- The encrypted data is sent over the network.
- The receiver uses a decryption key to convert the encrypted data back to its original form.

In HTTPS:
- The client and server perform a "handshake" to agree on an encryption method and exchange keys.
- They then use these keys to encrypt and decrypt data during their communication.

6. Keys in Cryptography

Keys are pieces of information (usually large numbers) used by the encryption algorithm to convert the data between its readable and encrypted forms.

Types of keys:
- Symmetric keys: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- Asymmetric keys: There are two related keys - a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

In HTTPS:
- Asymmetric encryption is used during the initial handshake to securely exchange a symmetric key.
- The symmetric key is then used for the bulk of the data encryption, as it's faster.

7. The HTTPS Process in Detail

1. Client Hello: The client (browser) sends a message to the server, including:
   - The highest TLS version it supports
   - A list of cipher suites it can use
   - A random number

2. Server Hello: The server responds with:
   - The chosen TLS version and cipher suite
   - Its SSL certificate (containing its public key)
   - Another random number

3. Certificate Check: The client verifies the server's SSL certificate with a trusted Certificate Authority.

4. Key Exchange: The client generates a "pre-master secret", encrypts it with the server's public key, and sends it to the server.

5. Session Keys Created: Both client and server use the random numbers and pre-master secret to generate the same symmetric "session keys".

6. Finished: Both sides send encrypted "Finished" messages to verify the process completed successfully.

7. Secure Communication: All further communication is encrypted using the session keys.

This system ensures that:
- The server is who it claims to be (authentication)
- Nobody else can read the data (confidentiality)
- The data can't be tampered with undetectably (integrity)


## Key Concepts in DynamoDB:
- Tables: Collections of items, similar to tables in traditional databases.
- Items: Individual records in a table, akin to rows in relational databases.
- Attributes: Data fields within an item, like columns in relational databases.
- Primary Key: Defines how items are uniquely identified in a table. DynamoDB supports two types of primary keys:
- Partition Key: A single attribute used to distribute data.
- Composite Key: A combination of a partition key and a sort key.


### 1. **Partition Key and Sort Key**
   - **Partition Key**: This is a single attribute (e.g., UserID) used to uniquely identify each item in the DynamoDB table. DynamoDB uses this key to distribute items across partitions, providing high availability and scalability.
   - **Sort Key**: When you use a composite primary key (partition key + sort key), the sort key is used to allow multiple items with the same partition key but different sort keys. This is useful for use cases like time-series data.

   **Interview Question**:  
   *"What’s the difference between a partition key and a sort key, and how do they impact data distribution?"*

   **Answer**:  
   *"The partition key is used by DynamoDB to determine the partition in which the data will be stored. A partition key alone ensures uniqueness for each item in the table. However, if you add a sort key, it allows multiple items with the same partition key but with a different sort key. This enables efficient querying of items with the same partition key but ordered or filtered by the sort key. Partition keys help distribute data across partitions, while sort keys allow for more fine-grained access patterns within each partition."*

### 2. **Provisioned Throughput and On-Demand Mode**
   - **Provisioned Throughput**: You manually specify the read and write capacity for your DynamoDB table. This approach can be cost-effective if your workload is predictable.
   - **On-Demand Mode**: DynamoDB automatically scales the read/write capacity based on traffic. This is useful for unpredictable workloads but can be more expensive if not optimized.

   **Interview Question**:  
   *"What are the differences between provisioned and on-demand capacity in DynamoDB, and when would you use each?"*

   **Answer**:  
   *"Provisioned throughput requires you to manually set the amount of read and write capacity, making it ideal for predictable workloads where traffic patterns are well understood, as it helps in cost optimization. On-demand mode, on the other hand, dynamically adjusts to handle incoming traffic without any need for manual intervention, which is ideal for applications with unpredictable or spiky traffic patterns. It eliminates the risk of over-provisioning or under-provisioning but can be more expensive for sustained high throughput workloads."*

### 3. **Global Secondary Index (GSI) and Local Secondary Index (LSI)**
   - **Global Secondary Index (GSI)**: An index that lets you query on non-primary key attributes. The GSI can have a different partition key and sort key than the main table, offering flexibility in querying.
   - **Local Secondary Index (LSI)**: Allows querying based on an alternate sort key while using the same partition key as the main table. You can only create LSIs when you create the table, and they provide a different way to sort data within partitions.

   **Interview Question**:  
   *"Can you explain the difference between a Global Secondary Index (GSI) and a Local Secondary Index (LSI), and when would you use each?"*

   **Answer**:  
   *"A Global Secondary Index (GSI) allows querying on non-primary key attributes and can have a different partition key and sort key than the main table. It provides flexibility in querying patterns. A Local Secondary Index (LSI) allows you to query within the same partition key but sort the data using a different attribute (sort key). You would use an LSI when you need to sort or query data within the same partition by different attributes. GSIs are more flexible because they don’t require the same partition key as the base table, whereas LSIs must share the partition key with the base table and can only be defined at table creation."*

### 4. **Consistency Models**
   - **Eventually Consistent Reads**: By default, DynamoDB provides eventually consistent reads, which means the data returned by a read operation might not reflect the results of a recently completed write.
   - **Strongly Consistent Reads**: You can request strongly consistent reads, ensuring that the most up-to-date data is returned. However, strong consistency may come at the cost of higher latency.

   **Interview Question**:  
   *"What’s the difference between eventually consistent reads and strongly consistent reads, and in what scenarios would you choose one over the other?"*

   **Answer**:  
   *"Eventually consistent reads allow for higher throughput but may return stale data since the latest write operation might not be reflected immediately. Eventually consistent reads are typically sufficient for scenarios where absolute freshness isn't critical, such as read-heavy workloads where performance is prioritized. Strongly consistent reads ensure that the data returned is the most up-to-date, but they may result in higher read latency and lower throughput. Strong consistency is necessary for use cases where data accuracy is paramount, like banking or inventory management systems where the latest updates must always be reflected."*

### 5. **Streams and DynamoDB Triggers**
   - **DynamoDB Streams**: Streams capture changes in DynamoDB tables (insert, update, and delete events) and allow you to trigger downstream processes, often used in event-driven architectures.
   - **Triggers**: You can use AWS Lambda with DynamoDB Streams to automatically execute some logic when a table is updated, like pushing updates to another service or triggering alerts.

   **Interview Question**:  
   *"What are DynamoDB Streams, and how can you use them in a real-world application?"*

   **Answer**:  
   *"DynamoDB Streams capture a time-ordered sequence of item-level changes in a table. This stream can be used to capture insert, update, and delete events. A common use case for Streams is to implement an event-driven architecture where changes to data in DynamoDB trigger downstream processing, such as updating another database, sending notifications, or syncing with external systems. AWS Lambda can be integrated with DynamoDB Streams to create 'triggers' that automatically execute a function when data changes in the table."*

### 6. **DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator)**
   - **DAX**: It is a fully managed, in-memory caching layer that can reduce read latency for DynamoDB tables to microseconds without requiring application changes. It’s especially useful for read-heavy workloads.

   **Interview Question**:  
   *"What is DAX in DynamoDB, and how does it improve performance?"*

   **Answer**:  
   *"DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator) is an in-memory caching layer for DynamoDB. It provides microsecond response times for read-heavy applications by caching data and reducing the number of read requests sent directly to DynamoDB. It’s especially beneficial for applications with a high read-to-write ratio or scenarios where low-latency reads are essential, such as gaming leaderboards, social media feeds, or recommendation engines. DAX is fully integrated with DynamoDB and can be enabled without changing the application logic."*

### 7. **Auto Scaling**
   - **Auto Scaling**: DynamoDB provides automatic scaling based on the traffic to your table. You can set up scaling policies to automatically adjust the read and write capacity to maintain performance.

   **Interview Question**:  
   *"How does auto-scaling work in DynamoDB, and what benefits does it provide?"*

   **Answer**:  
   *"Auto-scaling in DynamoDB automatically adjusts the read and write capacity of your tables based on traffic. You can define scaling policies that set the minimum and maximum capacity units. When traffic increases, DynamoDB scales up the provisioned throughput to handle the additional load, and when traffic decreases, it scales down to reduce costs. This ensures that the table always has sufficient capacity to handle traffic spikes while minimizing over-provisioning and reducing operational overhead. Auto-scaling is particularly useful for applications with unpredictable or cyclical traffic patterns."*

### 8. **TTL (Time to Live)**
   - **Time to Live (TTL)**: This feature allows you to automatically delete items after a certain period, helping manage space and reduce costs for data that is no longer relevant.

   **Interview Question**:  
   *"What is TTL in DynamoDB, and how would you use it in an application?"*

   **Answer**:  
   *"TTL (Time to Live) in DynamoDB allows you to define an expiration time for items, after which they are automatically deleted from the table. TTL is useful for managing data lifecycles, such as expiring session tokens, cleaning up old logs, or removing temporary data in a time-series application. It helps reduce storage costs by ensuring that stale data is automatically removed from the table without manual intervention."*

### Conclusion:
In an interview, it’s important to focus on explaining not just the functionality but also the **use cases** and **trade-offs** of each DynamoDB feature. Be ready to provide **real-world examples** and articulate the scenarios in which you'd choose DynamoDB over its alternatives. Highlight its **strengths** in terms of scalability, performance, and seamless integration with AWS, while acknowledging its limitations like query flexibility and potential costs.

By using this complex system of cryptography and key exchange, HTTPS provides a secure method for transmitting sensitive data over the internet, protecting against various types of attacks and ensuring privacy for users.



## Authntication mechanisms

Authentication mechanisms are essential for controlling access to resources and ensuring that only authorized users or systems can perform actions within an application. Each mechanism works in different ways and has its own use cases, advantages, and disadvantages. Let's dive into each:

### 1. **OAuth (Open Authorization)**
#### **Concept**:
OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way to grant websites or applications limited access to user information without exposing passwords. It allows users to authenticate through a third-party service (like Google, Facebook, etc.) and authorize an application to perform actions on their behalf.

#### **How It Works**:
- **Roles**:
  - **Resource Owner**: The person who owns the data (e.g., the user).
  - **Client**: The application requesting access to the user’s resources.
  - **Resource Server**: The server holding the user’s resources (e.g., Google).
  - **Authorization Server**: Authenticates the resource owner and provides access tokens.
  
- **Flow**:
  1. **Authorization Request**: The client redirects the user to an authorization server (e.g., Google’s OAuth page).
  2. **User Grants Authorization**: The user approves or denies the request.
  3. **Authorization Code**: If approved, an authorization code is sent back to the client.
  4. **Access Token**: The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token from the authorization server.
  5. **Accessing Resources**: The client uses the access token to request resources from the resource server.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Delegated access**: It allows applications to access resources on behalf of users without sharing passwords.
- **Widely adopted**: Many large companies (Google, Facebook) use it.
- **Granular permissions**: You can specify scopes, limiting what actions are allowed.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Complex setup**: OAuth can be tricky to implement due to various flows and roles.
- **Token security**: Access tokens can be vulnerable to exposure if not properly secured.
  
#### **Real-life Example**:
- Logging into a third-party website using your Google account.
  
#### **When to Use**:
- When you need delegated access or when a third-party identity provider is involved.

---

### 2. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**
#### **Concept**:
JWT is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information is digitally signed and can be verified, meaning the claims it contains can be trusted.

#### **How It Works**:
- **Structure**: JWT consists of three parts:
  1. **Header**: Contains metadata, such as the signing algorithm.
  2. **Payload**: Contains the claims (the data, like user info).
  3. **Signature**: Created by signing the header and payload using a secret key or a private key.

- **Flow**:
  1. **User Login**: A user logs in and, upon successful authentication, a JWT is generated.
  2. **Token Transmission**: The server sends the JWT to the client (often as an HTTP header).
  3. **Client Requests**: The client includes the JWT in the Authorization header for future requests.
  4. **Token Verification**: The server verifies the JWT’s signature on every request.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Stateless**: Since all user info is encoded in the token, no need for a session on the server.
- **Efficient**: Can be transmitted between multiple systems.
- **Scalable**: Works well in microservice architectures as tokens can be verified without central storage.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Token bloat**: JWT can become large if you add a lot of data to the payload.
- **No inherent token revocation**: Once issued, the token remains valid until it expires unless additional measures are taken to revoke it.

#### **Real-life Example**:
- After logging into an application like Spotify, your browser stores a JWT to prove you're authenticated in subsequent API calls.

#### **When to Use**:
- Stateless APIs, microservices, or where you need decentralized authentication.

---

### 3. **API Token**
#### **Concept**:
API tokens are unique identifiers that grant access to specific API functionalities. An API token is usually a long, random string that’s generated by the server and provided to the user or system requesting access.

#### **How It Works**:
- **Token Generation**: A client (user or application) requests an API token from the server.
- **Token Transmission**: The server generates the token and shares it with the client.
- **Requesting Resources**: The client includes the token in every request (usually in the Authorization header).
- **Token Validation**: The server verifies the token and allows or denies access based on its validity.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to generate and use.
- **Fine-grained control**: Tokens can be scoped to specific actions or users.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Not inherently secure**: If tokens are exposed (e.g., in URLs), they can be misused.
- **Requires storage**: The server needs to store tokens for validation.

#### **Real-life Example**:
- GitHub personal access tokens are API tokens that allow interaction with the GitHub API.

#### **When to Use**:
- For API integrations where you need to authenticate the client system, not the user.

---

### 4. **API Key**
#### **Concept**:
An API key is a simple, unique string of letters and numbers generated by a server and provided to the client. It’s a lightweight method to authenticate requests by validating that the client making the request has permission.

#### **How It Works**:
- **Key Generation**: The server generates an API key and provides it to the client.
- **Requesting Resources**: The client includes the API key in requests (often in the query string or header).
- **Key Validation**: The server checks the key and responds based on its validity.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and use.
- **Widely supported**: Many services accept API keys as authentication.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Security risks**: If exposed, API keys can be misused. They are often stored in headers or URLs, making them vulnerable.
- **Limited functionality**: API keys don't provide as much fine-grained control as tokens (e.g., no user delegation).

#### **Real-life Example**:
- Google Cloud uses API keys to authenticate requests to some services.

#### **When to Use**:
- When you need simple, lightweight authentication and the resource being accessed is not highly sensitive.

---

### 5. **Basic Authentication**
#### **Concept**:
Basic Authentication is a simple method for an HTTP user agent to provide a username and password when making a request. It encodes the credentials in Base64 and includes them in the Authorization header.

#### **How It Works**:
- **Request**: The client sends a request with the Authorization header containing `Basic <Base64 encoded username:password>`.
- **Validation**: The server decodes the credentials and checks them against stored values.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Simplicity**: Very easy to implement with minimal overhead.
- **Widespread support**: Supported by virtually all HTTP clients.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Security concerns**: The credentials are only Base64 encoded, not encrypted. Using this over plain HTTP exposes the credentials.
- **No session management**: Requires credentials to be sent with every request.

#### **Real-life Example**:
- Older APIs like those for basic FTP services often use Basic Authentication.

#### **When to Use**:
- For non-sensitive, internal applications where simplicity is needed, or with HTTPS to ensure encryption.

---

### **How to Choose**:
1. **Security needs**: 
   - For high-security needs, OAuth or JWT is recommended.
   - For simple systems, API Keys or API Tokens may suffice.

2. **User delegation**: 
   - If the application needs to access a user's resources on another service, OAuth is the best choice.

3. **Stateless**: 
   - For stateless applications (like REST APIs), JWT or API Tokens are a good fit.

4. **Ease of implementation**: 
   - Basic Authentication or API Keys are simpler to implement but come with security trade-offs.
